if we click on a cell and it has a mine, you lose
if we click on a cell and it doesn't have a mine, you open it. Two things can happen

if a square adjacent to it has a mine, then show total number of Minesweeper
if no adjacent cells have a mine then we unhide it , and open all cells next to it and check for information

if we click on a mine on our first turn, reset board and try again
